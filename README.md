# Parking Lot Management System 🚗

This project is a **Parking Lot Management System** that streamlines the management of parking spaces, vehicle entries/exits, and parking fees. Built with Next.js and MongoDB, it provides an intuitive interface for adding, viewing, and managing parking records.

## Features ✨

- **Dynamic Parking Management**: Handles parking records with real-time updates.
- **Parking Limit Control**: Restricts the number of parked vehicles to a predefined limit.
- **Parking Fee Calculation**: Automatically calculates parking fees based on the duration of stay.
- **Record Management**: Allows adding and deleting parking records.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly and responsive interface.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Frontend**: React.js with Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **State Management**: React `useState` and `useEffect`

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Install the latest version from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- **MongoDB**: Set up a MongoDB database (local or cloud-based, such as MongoDB Atlas).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parking-lot-management.git
   cd parking-lot-management
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage 📝

### Add Parking Record

1. Fill in the form with vehicle details and entry/exit times.
2. Click the "Submit" button.
3. If parking spaces are available, the record is added, and the calculated fee is displayed.

### Delete Parking Record

1. Click the "Delete" button next to a parking record to remove it.

### Parking Fee Calculation

* The fee is calculated dynamically based on the duration of stay (e.g., hourly rate). The calculated fee is displayed upon record addition.

### Parking Limit

* The system enforces a parking limit. If the limit is reached, users are informed that the parking lot is full.
